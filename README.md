hey, i'm winit

i mess around with backend systems, fintech and anything super fast. i'm from ahmedabad, india and i'm 20 years old.

most of my professional experience has been with web3 (solana & eth) working on solutions around liquidity management and prediction markets. i'm trying to break through into the web2 bandwagon purely. 

i love
